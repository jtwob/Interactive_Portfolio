# Interactive Portfolio
## Details
This is a webpage dedicated to being an interactive portfolio for me, James Totah. It features an About me page with links, a portfolio page with images of myself, and a contact page, that has yet to be implemented on the backend. Gridding was used to fit all the elements in their proper places. All of this was accomplished with bootstrap.
